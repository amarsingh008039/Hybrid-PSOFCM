# Hybrid-PSOFCM
Fuzzy Clustering Means applied on Iris Dataset and Particle Swarm Optimization to optimize the results.
All the programs are written in Octave . Both Fuzzy Clustering Means and Hybrid of Particle Swarm Optimization and Fuzzy Clustering Means are applied on the Iris dataset and results are evaluated by Fmeasure. 
-To look for how FCM is applied program starts from file 'start.m' which calls 'FCM.m' 
-To look for how Hybrid of PSO and FCM is applied , program starts from file 'try1.m' which calls 'HPSOFCMtry.m' .
